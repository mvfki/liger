```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
```

Before setting up the "rliger" package, users should have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) version 3.6.0 or higher. 
  
## LIGER is available on CRAN

To install the latest stable release, please run the following command in R console:

```{R}
install.packages("rliger")
```

## Lastest developmental version

The developmental versions are accessible from GitHub. We are currently contributing to the repository "mvfki/liger" in branch "newObj".

```{R}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mvfki/liger@newObj")
```

If you encounter issues when building from GitHub (source), please see below sections for details about some dependencies.

**Please note that the latest version (>=1.9.9) is massively updated compared to prior versions, and functions are not directly compatible with the old version objects which users might possess. Please use `readLiger()` to load old RDS files or `convertOldLiger()` to convert a loaded object into the up-to-date structure. You might need to be careful when overwriting existing analysis because we don't provide methods to convert new the structure backwards.**

### Compiler setup

Installation from CRAN is easy because pre-compiled binaries are available for Windows and MacOS. However, a few additional steps are required to install from source on MacOS/Windows.

Windows users will need to install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) which can be downloaded from CRAN. After downloading it, open the file and follow the prompt to install.

MacOS users will need Clang and gfortran, which can also be found on [CRAN Mac Tools](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/).

### Installing HDF5 Library

HDF5 library is required for interacting with H5 files. It can be installed via the following commands.

| System                                    | Command
|:------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
|OS X (using Homebrew or Conda)         | `brew install hdf5` or `conda install -c anaconda hdf5`
|Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu) | `sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev`
|Systems supporting yum and RPMs        | `sudo yum install hdf5-devel`
|Windows | Go to [HDF5 website](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/) and download the proper installer

### Installing RcppPlanc

[RcppPlanc](https://github.com/welch-lab/RcppPlanc) is an extension R package built basing on [Planc](https://github.com/ramkikannan/planc). We implemented highly optimized iNMF algorithm and its variants here for the new version upgrade. It can be obtained also from CRAN with:

```{R}
install.packages("RcppPlanc")
```

For latest developmental version, please refer to [RcppPlanc GitHub repository](https://github.com/welch-lab/RcppPlanc) for detail.

### Installing Flt-SNE

For dimensionality reduction, we have options of UMAP and t-SNE. For UMAP, we depend on "uwot" which is readily scalable with large datasets. For t-SNE, we by default use "Rtsne", which is not scalable for large datasets. We allow using another implementation of t-SNE, namingly Flt-SNE, for efficient computation. Flt-SNE is not distributed with the package or CRAN, thus users need to install it following steps below.

#### 1. Install FFTW library.

Download FFTW from [here](http://www.fftw.org/). For UNIX like users, run the following command in terminal.

```{bash}
tar -xvzf  fftw-x.x.x.tar.gz
cd fftw-x.x.x.tar.gz
./configure
make
make install
```

#### 2. Install Flt-SNE

`cd` to a desired location, and run

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/KlugerLab/FIt-SNE.git
cd FIt-SNE
g++ -std=c++11 -O3  src/sptree.cpp src/tsne.cpp src/nbodyfft.cpp  -o bin/fast_tsne -pthread -lfftw3 -lm
pwd
```

#### 3. Run t-SNE with Flt-SNE

Now, we've had the binary compiled, and command `pwd` shows the location to the binary. Then back to an R LIGER analysis, the following command can be used to invoke the binary.

```{R}
ligerObj <- runTSNE(ligerObj, method = "fftRtsne", fitsnePath = "whatPWDShows")
```
