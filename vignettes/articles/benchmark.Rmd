In *rliger 2.1.0*, we released a new cell factor loading alignment method which has been outperforming our previous quantile normalization method as well as many existing well known methods, in terms of the power of batch effect correction and conservation of biological information. In this vignette, we demonstrate how the performance was benchmarked with a number of metrics. 

The benchmarking metrics aim at evaluating single-cell data integration methods and the generalized framework was proposed in original work in [Luecken, M.D., *Nat Methods* 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01336-8), by Theis Lab. In this vignette, we will do the following steps to benchmark our new method and compare it with other methods:

1. Load the dataset that was used in the original work
2. Run LIGER's new method
3. Calculate benchmarking metrics on the new result, using Python package [*scib*](https://github.com/theislab/scib) from Theis Lab. 
4. Rank the new method with existing methods

## Dataset

The SCIB (Single-cell integration benchmarking) paper benchmarked single-cell data integration methods on a number of datasets with various complexities. Here, we show how to benchmark LIGER's new method on the human pancreas dataset. 

The pancreas integration task consists of batches sequenced with different technologies, including CEL-Seq, Fluidigm C1, inDrop, Smart-Seq and etc. Moreover, the cell composition in each batch varies. For example, the CEL-Seq and CEL-Seq2 batches contributed by Muraro MJ 2016 and GrÃ¼n D 2016, respectively, pooled cells using the Islets of Langerhans from human cadaveric pancreata at  atlas level and contains main and rare pancreatic cell types. While the SMARTer batch contributed by Xin Y 2016, only contains the main pancreatic cell types.

SCIB has provided the cleaned dataset with cell type annotation unified across batches. The dataset is ready for download and is presented in an AnnData object stored in the H5AD file listed below:

>Click to download and **save at working directory**: [**human_pancreas_norm_complexBatch.h5ad**](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/24539828)

## Python environment

The SCIB framework is wrapped in a Python package *scib* and the metric calculation can be easily done with a function call to a prepared AnnData object. To install the *scib* package, we recommand creating a conda environment and install the package with `pip`.

The commands below shows an example of how to create the conda environment and install the package in system terminal or command-line prompt (NOT R COMMANDS). Users can freely explore other ways to get the package installed.


```{bash, eval=FALSE}
# In terminal/commandline
conda create -n scib python=3.9.0
conda activate scib
pip install scib
```

## Preprocessing

Here we use SCIB's method to identify the highly variable genes (HVGs) before running LIGER integration. While LIGER has its own HVG selection strategy, we decided to use SCIB's method to ensure a fair comparison with other methods, which were benchmarked with the same set of HVGs. This method requests for `n` (default 2,000) top variable genes from each batch first. Then, the list of HVGs was ranked first by the number of batches in which the genes were highly variable and second by the mean dispersion parameter across batches. Finally, the top `n` genes were selected for downstream use. 

In a Python session, import the necessary modules and load the dataset downloaded from the link above. 

```{python}
# Python code
import scib
import scanpy as sc

adata = sc.read_h5ad("human_pancreas_norm_complexBatch.h5ad")
adata
```

From the printed information, the `adata.obs` column "tech" represents the batch information.

Next, we run the HVG selection method from *scib*.

```{python}
# Python code
hvg = scib.pp.hvg_batch(adata, batch_key='tech')
```

The selected HVGs are stored in a `list` object `hvg`. We simply write the `list` to a text file, with one gene per line without separators, so that we can load it back to R later easily. 

```{python, results='hide'}
# Python code
with open("pancreas_hvgs.txt", "w") as f:
    for gene in hvg:
        f.write(f"{gene}\n")

f.close()
```

## Construct liger object

Back to R, now we can load the H5AD data to R and construct a [liger object](liger_object.html). There is no single function that can load the H5AD file directly to a liger object due to the fact that people may have very distinct ways to construct an AnnData object. Here we show particularly how the pancreas dataset is manually loaded into a liger object, step by step.

First, load the necessary R libraries

```{r}
library(hdf5r)
library(rliger)
```

The R package *hdf5r* provides an interface to interact with HDF5 based files, which is the base format of an H5AD file. The *rliger* package is the R implementation of LIGER.

Secondly, open the H5AD file so we can extract necessary data. 

```{r}
h5ad <- H5File$new("human_pancreas_norm_complexBatch.h5ad", mode = "r")
```

With the connection to the H5AD file open, we can subsequently extract the raw counts and metadata. Notice that the raw counts are stored in a dense matrix in the H5AD file, which is very rare in practice for single-cell data. We need to convert it to sparse matrix before constructing the liger object. Please view [*hdf5r* vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hdf5r/vignettes/hdf5r.html) for more information of its usage.

```{r}
# Loading the raw counts from H5AD file
h5ad.raw <- h5ad[['layers/counts']][,]
h5ad.raw.rownames <- h5ad[['var/_index']][]
h5ad.raw.colnames <- h5ad[['obs/_index']][]
dimnames(h5ad.raw) <- list(h5ad.raw.rownames, h5ad.raw.colnames)
# Convert it liger compatible sparse matrix
h5ad.raw <- as(h5ad.raw, "CsparseMatrix")

# Extract necessary metadata
h5ad.meta.dataset <- factor(
    h5ad[['obs/__categories/tech']][][h5ad[['obs/tech']][] + 1], 
    levels = h5ad[['obs/__categories/tech']][]
)
h5ad.meta.cell_type <- factor(
    h5ad[['obs/__categories/celltype']][][h5ad[['obs/celltype']][] + 1], 
    levels = h5ad[['obs/__categories/celltype']][]
)
pancreas.meta <- data.frame(
    barcode = h5ad.raw.colnames,
    dataset = h5ad.meta.dataset,
    cell_type = h5ad.meta.cell_type,
    row.names = paste0(h5ad.meta.dataset, "_", h5ad.raw.colnames)
)
```

Now, with all data loaded, we can head to constructing the liger object. The raw counts data is presented as a single matrix with all batches merged. In this case, we call `as.liger()` function instead of using `createLiger()` which is defined for creating liger object from a list of matrices, each a batch. Please view our [guide for importing data](import_data.html) for more guide in detail.

```{r}
# Construct liger object, from the sparse matrix containing all batches
lig <- as.liger(h5ad.raw, datasetVar = pancreas.meta$dataset)
```

Lastly, insert other necessary metadata and the previously selected HVGs into the liger object. Note that we assigned the `rownames`

```{r}
# Match the metadata with the liger object
pancreas.meta.ordered <- pancreas.meta[colnames(lig),]

# Insert metadata into liger object
lig$cell_type <- pancreas.meta.ordered$cell_type
defaultCluster(lig) <- "cell_type"

# Load previously identified HVGs and set to liger object
hvg <- readLines("pancreas_hvgs.txt")
varFeatures(lig) <- hvg

lig
```

## Run liger integration

The following code chunk simply run the LIGER integration pipeline. For a more detailed guidance on running LIGER, please refer to our [basic tutorial](Integrating_multi_scRNA_data.html). A few notes to mention here. We **don't** run `selectGenes()` function as we have already selected HVGs. For `runIntegration()` function, argument `k` represents the number of ranks we factorize the batches into. These can be interpreted as metagenes that represents biological factors. The number of factors is arbitrarily chosen and can be adjusted based on the dataset. Higher `k` may be selected when complex composition is expected from the whole dataset. Lastly, we need to set `method = "centroidAlign"` in `alignFactors()` function to use the new alignment method.

```{r}
lig <- lig %>%
    normalize() %>%
    scaleNotCenter() %>%
    runIntegration(k = 40) %>%
    alignFactors(method = "centroidAlign")
```

After the integration, we can optionally visualize the data by creating UMAP dimensionality reduction embedding using the integrated data. And color the UMAP either by batch source or by cell type annotation.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=14, fig.height=5}
lig <- runUMAP(lig, minDist = .3)
options(ligerDotSize = 0.7)

p1 <- plotDatasetDimRed(
    lig, 
    colorValues = c(
         "#BD0026", "#FC4E2A",                       # For celseq and celseq2,
         "#78C679",                                  # For fluidigmc1
         "#045A8D", "#0570B0", "#3690C0", "#74A9CF", # For inDrop1-4
         "#AA47B9",                                  # For smarter
         "#FE9929"                                   # For smartseq2
    )
)
p2 <- plotClusterDimRed(lig, legendNCol = 1)

cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

## Export to H5AD

In order to utilize *scib* prepared metric calculation functions, we need to export the result from the liger object to an H5AD file. This functionality has been implemented in a single function call to `ligerToH5AD()`. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
if (file.exists("human_pancreas_liger_integrated.h5ad")) {
    unlink("human_pancreas_liger_integrated.h5ad")
} 
```

```{r}
ligerToH5AD(lig, "human_pancreas_liger_integrated.h5ad")
```

## Run SCIB metrics

Back to a Python session, we can now work on the integrated data and start to calculate all SCIB metrics. 

First, import necessary modules and load the integrated data.

```{python}
# Python code
import scib
import scanpy as sc

adata = sc.read_h5ad("human_pancreas_liger_integrated.h5ad")
adata
```

Prespecify a few variables that will be re-used as parameters for many of the metric calculation functions. `label_key` refers to the column name in `adata.obs` for the ground truth cell type annotation. We simply use what was provided in the original data, as this has been curated by the original SCIB work. `batch_key` is the column in `adata.obs` that represents the batch information. `use_rep` and `embed` are the same thing and they refer to the low-dimensional representation of the integrated data, located in `adata.obsm`.

```{python}
# Python code
label_key = "cell_type"
batch_key = "dataset"
use_rep = "X_h_norm"
embed = "X_h_norm"
```

One more preprocessing that is crucial to calculating part of the metrics is to obtain a clustering result that is based on the integration. *scib* provides a optimized clustering method that tries a sequence of resolutions and returns the clustering result with the highest NMI score compared to the ground truth. An NMI score evalutates the agreement between two categorical variables and will be introduced later.

```{python}
# Python code
sc.pp.neighbors(adata, use_rep=use_rep)
scib.metrics.cluster_optimal_resolution(adata, label_key=label_key, cluster_key='leiden')
```

Lastly, we also need the original unintegrated data, since some of the metrics works by comparing the integrated data against it. We load the data into another AnnData object and do some cleaning to match the integrated data.

```{python}
# Python code
adata_unintegrated = sc.read_h5ad("human_pancreas_norm_complexBatch.h5ad")

# Update `adata_unintegrated` .obs_name, by concatenating `adata_unintegrated.obs['tech']` and `adata_unintegrated.obs_names`, sep with '_'
new_obs_names = []
for tech, obs_name in zip(adata_unintegrated.obs['tech'], adata_unintegrated.obs_names):
    new_obs_names.append(tech + '_' + obs_name)

adata_unintegrated.obs_names = new_obs_names

# Reorder `adata_unintegrated` to match `adata`
adata_unintegrated = adata_unintegrated[adata.obs_names,]

# Rename columns in `adata_unintegrated.obs` to match `adata.obs`
adata_unintegrated.obs = adata_unintegrated.obs.rename(columns={'tech': 'dataset', 'celltype': 'cell_type'})
```

Now we can start to compute each metrics using functions prepared within *scib* package. We briefly describe what each metric means and how it is calculated. For more details of them, please refer to [the Method section of the original SCIB paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01336-8#Sec14).

### Metrics for batch effect removal

#### Batch PCR

PCR (principal component regression) method calculates the $R^2$ from a linear regression of the batch variable onto each principal component. By multiplying the $R^2$ with the variance explained for each principal component, PCR can then derive the total variance explained by the batch variable. 

```{python}
pancreas_pcr_batch = scib.metrics.pcr_comparison(
    adata_pre=adata_unintegrated, 
    adata_post=adata, 
    covariate=batch_key, 
    embed=embed
)
pancreas_pcr_batch
```

#### Batch ASW

ASW (average silhouette width) is generally a metric that measures within-group distances of a cell and the between-group distances of that cell to the closest group. Averaging over all silhouette widths of a set of cells yields the ASW, so that a higher ASW indicates better separation and lower ASW indicates stronger mixing. By grouping cells by their batch information within each cell type, reversed ASW scores can be utilized to evaluate how well the batch labels are mixed.

```{python}
pancreas_batch_asw = scib.metrics.silhouette_batch(adata=adata, batch_key=batch_key, label_key=label_key, embed=embed)
pancreas_batch_asw
```

#### Graph iLISI

LISI (local inverse Simpson index) scores are computed from neighborhood lists per node from integrated kNN graphs. It counts the number of unique labels in the neighborhood of a cell, so that a number closer to total number of labels indicates better mixing and 1 indicates perfect separation. By looking at the the batch labels, iLISI scores can be used to evaluate how well the batch labels are mixed. 

Note that since the final iLISI score is averaged for all cells, integration tasks that contain batches with distinct cell type composition might not necessarily obtain a high iLISI score.

```{python}
pancreas_graph_ilisi = scib.metrics.ilisi_graph(adata=adata, batch_key=batch_key, type_="embed", use_rep=use_rep, n_cores=4)
pancreas_graph_ilisi
```

#### Graph connectivity

This method first subsets the kNN graph of the integrated data to contain only cells of one cell type, and then compares the size of the largest connected component against the size of the whole subset graph. So that a higher connectivity score indicates better mixing with each cell type.

```{python}
pancreas_graph_connectivity = scib.metrics.graph_connectivity(adata=adata, label_key=label_key)
pancreas_graph_connectivity
```

#### kBET

kBET ([BÃ¼ttner, M. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0254-1)) determines whether the label composition of the neighborhood of a cell is similar to the expected (global) label composition.

```{python}
pancreas_kBET = scib.metrics.kBET(adata=adata, batch_key=batch_key, label_key=label_key, type_='embed', embed=embed)
pancreas_kBET
```

### Metrics for bio conservation

#### NMI and ARI

NMI (normalized mutual information) and ARI (adjusted Rand index) both compares the overlap of two clusterings. Here we compare the clustering result we previously obtained from the integrated data against the cell type labeling, with higher scores indicating better agreement. 

```{python}
pancreas_nmi = scib.metrics.nmi(adata=adata, cluster_key='leiden', label_key=label_key)
pancreas_nmi
```

```{python}
pancreas_ari = scib.metrics.ari(adata=adata, cluster_key='leiden', label_key=label_key)
pancreas_ari
```

#### Cell type ASW

Recall that we used a reversed ASW measurement for batch effect removal, here we group cells by the cell type labels. Therefore, a higher ASW indicates the original cell types can be properly separated after integration.

```{python}
pancreas_cell_type_asw = scib.metrics.silhouette(adata=adata, label_key=label_key, embed=embed)
pancreas_cell_type_asw
```

#### F1 score for isolated label

To evaluate how well the integration methods deal with cell types shared by few batches, the SCIB work developed several metrics that focus on the isolated labels. The isolated label is defined as the label that presents in the least number of batches. 

F1 score is a weighted mean of precision and recall of a clustering. The cluster assignment of the isolated label is optimized for a range a resolutions and the optimal F1 score for the isolated label is reported. A value of 1 1 shows that all of the isolated label cells and no others are captured in a cluster.


```{python}
pancreas_isolated_label_F1 = scib.metrics.isolated_labels_f1(adata=adata, label_key=label_key, batch_key=batch_key, embed=embed)
pancreas_isolated_label_F1
```

#### ASW for isolated label

For the isolated label as defined in the last metric, the ASW score for a cell is calculated by comparing its distances within the isolated label versus in the non-isolated labels. After scaling, a higher isolated label ASW score indicates better separation of the isolated label from the rest of the data.

```{python}
pancreas_isolated_label_silhouette = scib.metrics.isolated_labels_asw(adata=adata, label_key=label_key, batch_key=batch_key, embed=embed)
pancreas_isolated_label_silhouette
```

#### Graph cLISI

Recall that we used iLISI for batch effect removal, here we use look at the cell type labeling within the neighborhood of each cell. While less unique labels in the neighbor hood indicates better separation of cell types, the score is then scaled in a way that a higher cLISI score indicates better separation of cell types.

```{python}
pancreas_graph_clisi = scib.metrics.clisi_graph(adata, label_key=label_key, type_='embed', use_rep=use_rep, n_cores=4)
pancreas_graph_clisi
```

#### Cell cycle conservation

A cell-cycle score is first computed for each respective cell-cycle phase and for each cell. Then for each batch, the method computes the variance contribution of the resulting S and G2/M phase scores using PCR. The differences in variance before and after integration were aggregated into a final score.

```{python}
pancreas_cell_cycle_conservation = scib.metrics.cell_cycle(adata_pre=adata_unintegrated, adata_post=adata, batch_key=batch_key, embed=embed, organism='human')
pancreas_cell_cycle_conservation
```

#### HVG conservation

By comparing the overlap between highly variable genes (HVGs) that can be identified from unintegrated data and those identified from batch-corrected data, the HVG conservation score can servea as a proxy for the preservation of the biological signal. However, this metric can only be applied for integration methods that return feature expression matrices.

### Summary

Now that we've calculated all the metrics, we can print them out to have a look and save them to a CSV file for further analysis.

```{python}
# Python code
import pandas as pd

pancreas_all_metrics = {
    "pancreas_pcr_batch": pancreas_pcr_batch,
    "pancreas_batch_asw": pancreas_batch_asw,
    "pancreas_graph_ilisi": pancreas_graph_ilisi,
    "pancreas_graph_connectivity": pancreas_graph_connectivity,
    "pancreas_kBET": pancreas_kBET,
    "pancreas_nmi": pancreas_nmi,
    "pancreas_ari": pancreas_ari,
    "pancreas_cell_type_asw": pancreas_cell_type_asw,
    "pancreas_isolated_label_F1": pancreas_isolated_label_F1,
    "pancreas_isolated_label_silhouette": pancreas_isolated_label_silhouette,
    "pancreas_graph_clisi": pancreas_graph_clisi,
    "pancreas_cell_cycle_conservation": pancreas_cell_cycle_conservation
}
for metric, score in pancreas_all_metrics.items():
    print(f"{metric}: {score}")
```

```{python}
# Python code
pancreas_metrics_df = pd.DataFrame(pancreas_all_metrics, index=[0])
pancreas_metrics_df.to_csv("pancreas_liger_scores.csv", index=False)
```

## Ranking with existing scores

In the original work of SCIB, the scores for a single method may not be directly useful to see how well the method overally performs compared to others. Therefore, the authors proposed a way to scale the scores and calculate an overall score with all methods' scores together. The overall score is calculated as a weighted sum of the batch correction and bio conservation scores. The batch correction score and the bio conservation score are calculated as the average of the scaled scores of each single metrics that belong to the category. The authors applied min-max scaling to the scores of each metric, so that the scores are in the range of 0 to 1. In this way, the difference of performance between methods can be better reflected.

$$
\begin{aligned}
score^*_{i,j} &= \frac{score_{i,j} - min(score_{,j})}{max(score_{,j}) - min(score_{,j})} \\
batch_{i} &= \frac{1}{|BATCH|}\sum_{j}^{BATCH} score^*_{i,j} \\
bio_{i} &= \frac{1}{|BIO|}\sum_{j}^{BIO} score^*_{i,j} \\
Overall_i &= 0.6 \times bio_{i} + 0.4 \times batch_{i}
\end{aligned}
$$

Assume we put the scores for all methods and all metrics in a matrix, where a row is for all metrics of a method, and a column is the scores of a metric listed with all methods. The above formula can be applied to calculate the overall score for each method. $score$ is the original score matrix, $i$ is the row index for a method, $j$ is the column index for a metric, $score^*_{i,j}$ is the scaled score for method $i$ and metric $j$. $BATCH$ is the set of batch correction metrics, $BIO$ is the set of bio conservation metrics. $|BATCH|$ is the number of batch correction metrics we have in total, for example, 5 for what *scib* currently provides. Similarly, $|BIO|$ is the number of bio conservation metrics, 8 in our case. $batch_{i}$ is the batch correction score for method $i$, $bio_{i}$ is the bio conservation score for method $i$, and $Overall_i$ is the overall score for method $i$.

### Load all other scores

Based on what we described above, we need to load the scores the SCIB work already calculated and insert our new scores into the pool to have all methods re-ranked.

The full benchmarking scores for the human pancreas dataset task is available in [the Supplementary Information of SCIB's orginal publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01336-8#Sec35), freely available as Supplementary Data 1. 

>Click to download Supplementary Data 1 and **save to working directory**: [**41592_2021_1336_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx**](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41592-021-01336-8/MediaObjects/41592_2021_1336_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx)

Now we need to load a few more R libraries for data manipulation. Given that the supplementary data provided is an Excel file with multiple sheets, each sheet is for a different dataset task. We need to also locate which sheet is for the human pancreas dataset task. `excel_sheets()` function from *readxl* package can help us with this.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

excel_sheets("41592_2021_1336_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx")
```

The scores for the human pancreas dataset task is stored in sheet 10 from listed above. Now we can load the sheet into one `data.frame` object in R. Note that there are `NA` values in the result, mainly due to the fact that some metrics are not applicable to some methods. For example, the HVG conservation metric is not applicable to LIGER. Be sure to tell the `read_excel()` function how to handle these values.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
pancreas_scores <- read_excel(
    path = "41592_2021_1336_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx", 
    sheet = 10, 
    na = "NA"
)
pancreas_scores <- as.data.frame(pancreas_scores)
```

Here is how the table looks like:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
DT::datatable(pancreas_scores, options = list(scrollX = TRUE)) %>%
    DT::formatRound(columns = 6:21, digits = 3)
```

### Insert scores for new LIGER

Now we load back the scores we just calculated for LIGER's new method and insert it to the full table before we can scale the scores and obtain the final overall scores.

```{r}
liger_scores <- read.csv("pancreas_liger_scores.csv")

# Make a one-row data.frame that matches to the columns from the full table
liger_scores_reformat <- data.frame(
    # Dataset,  Method,   Output,  Feaetures, Scaling,  Overall
    "pancreas", "LIGER2", "embed", "HVG",     "scaled", NA, 
    # Overall score above left as NA, yet to be calculated
    # Batch score, and individual batch metrics
    # Batch score left as NA, yet to be calculated
    NA, liger_scores$pancreas_pcr_batch, liger_scores$pancreas_batch_asw, 
    liger_scores$pancreas_graph_ilisi, liger_scores$pancreas_graph_connectivity, 
    liger_scores$pancreas_kBET, 
    # Bio score, and individual bio metrics
    # Bio score left as NA, yet to be calculated
    NA, liger_scores$pancreas_nmi, liger_scores$pancreas_ari, 
    liger_scores$pancreas_cell_type_asw, liger_scores$pancreas_isolated_label_F1, 
    liger_scores$pancreas_isolated_label_silhouette, 
    liger_scores$pancreas_graph_clisi, 
    liger_scores$pancreas_cell_cycle_conservation, NA
    # HVG score left as NA, not applicable
)
colnames(liger_scores_reformat) <- colnames(pancreas_scores)
all_scores <- rbind(pancreas_scores, liger_scores_reformat)
```

### Calculate scaled scores

Following the formula described earlier, we then calculate the scaled scores for each metric, derive the average batch score and average bio score for each method. The `scaleMinMax()` function is defined in short below so it can be `apply()`ed to each column (`MARGIN = 2`) in a neat way.

```{r}
# x - expect to be a column from the score table, containing the scores for a 
#     metric, from all methods
# `na.rm = TRUE` indicates that we want to ignore NA values when calculating min 
# and max
scaleMinMax <- function(x) {
    (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE))/(max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}

# Calculate batch scores
batch_scores <- all_scores[, 8:12]
batch_scores.scaled <- as.data.frame(
    apply(X = batch_scores, MARGIN = 2, FUN = scaleMinMax)
)
all_scores$`Batch Correction` <- rowMeans(batch_scores.scaled, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate bio scores
bio_scores <- all_scores[, 14:21]
bio_scores.scaled <- as.data.frame(
    apply(X = bio_scores, MARGIN = 2, FUN = scaleMinMax)
)
all_scores$`Bio conservation` <- rowMeans(bio_scores.scaled, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Overall ranking

Lastly, we can now reach to the overall score for each method and have our new method ranked among all others.

```{r}
# Calculate overall scores
all_scores$`Overall Score` <- 0.6*all_scores$`Bio conservation` + 0.4*all_scores$`Batch Correction`

# Rank all methods by overall score
all_scores <- all_scores[order(all_scores$`Overall Score`, decreasing = TRUE),]
rownames(all_scores) <- NULL
```

Now we can see the updated overall scores and the new ranking.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DT::datatable(all_scores, options = list(scrollX = TRUE)) %>%
    DT::formatRound(columns = 6:21, digits = 3) %>%
    DT::formatStyle(seq_along(.), backgroundColor = DT::styleRow(1, '#BBED80'))
```
